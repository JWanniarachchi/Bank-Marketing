**Dear Sir/Miss,**

**How to Run the Bank Marketing Model**

To explore the Bank Marketing project, please follow the instructions below:

1. **Click on the [Bank Marketing.ipynb](https://github.com/JWanniarachchi/Bank-Marketing/blob/main/Bank_Marketing_.ipynb) file.** It will open directly in Google Colab.

2. **If the Notebook Doesn't Open in Colab:**

    If for any reason the notebook doesn't open directly in Colab, visit [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/).
    Once you're on Colab, go to **File > Open Notebook**, then select the **GitHub** tab.
    Copy and paste the URL of this GitHub repository into the search bar to access the notebook.

3. **Upload the Dataset:**

    Once the notebook is opened in Colab, you'll need to upload the dataset. I have already added the CSV file in the same repository. Follow the instructions in the notebook to upload the [bank-marketing.csv](https://github.com/JWanniarachchi/Bank-Marketing/blob/main/bank-marketing.csv) file to Colab.

4. **Run the Code:**

    After the dataset is uploaded, execute the cells in the notebook to run the Bank Marketing Model. You’ll be able to view the results, including evaluation metrics and visualizations like the ROC curve.
