Dear Sir/ Miss,

How to Run the Bank Marketing Model

To explore the Bank Marketing project, please follow the instructions below:

1. Click on the Bank Marketing.ipynb file. It will open directly in Google Colab.

2. If the Notebook Doesn't Open in Colab:

    If for any reason the notebook doesn't open directly in Colab, visit Google Colab.
    Once you're on Colab, go to File > Open Notebook, then select the GitHub tab.
    Copy and paste the URL of this GitHub repository into the search bar to access the notebook.

3. Upload the Dataset:

    Once the notebook is opened in Colab, you'll need to upload the dataset. I have already added the csv file in the same repository. Follow the instructions in the notebook to upload the bank-marketing.csv file to Colab.

4. Run the Code:

    After the dataset is uploaded, execute the cells in the notebook to run the Bank Marketing Model. Youâ€™ll be able to view the results, including evaluation metrics and visualizations like the ROC curve.[bank-additional.csv](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/18285925/bank-additional.csv)
